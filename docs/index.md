-   :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg .middle } **Extreme Efficiency**
    ---
    By employing an intelligent skip agent scheduling algorithm, the inference overhead in multi-turn dialogues is significantly reduced.

-   :material-source-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Multi-Strategy Driven**
    ---
    It has multiple built-in search and reasoning strategies, supporting everything from simple parallel chains to complex tree-structured search layouts.

-   :material-engine:{ .lg .middle } **Plug-In Architecture**
    ---
    Easily integrates with various mainstream LLM APIs (Qwen, GPT, DeepSeek) and supports custom agent logic.

-   :material-chart-bar:{ .lg .middle } **Deep Visualization**
    ---
    It provides a complete visualization tool for reasoning paths, making the decision-making process of multi-agent systems clear and transparent.
